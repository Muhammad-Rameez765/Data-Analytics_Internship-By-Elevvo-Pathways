# Storytelling: Sales Performance Dashboard Using Excel
I created a Sales Performance Dashboard in Excel using the Superstore dataset from Kaggle to analyze overall sales distribution and identify top-performing business dimensions. The process started with importing the dataset into Excel and cleaning it by removing duplicates, correcting data types, and formatting the sales column as currency. I also derived useful information from text fields, like extracting the year from the Order ID, to enable better grouping in analysis.

Instead of focusing on monthly trends, I chose to emphasize business dimensions like region, category, and segment, which provided more strategic insights for stakeholders. Using pivot tables, I summarized key sales metrics, then created interactive pivot charts such as bar and pie charts to visually showcase performance.

I added slicers to the dashboard, allowing users to dynamically filter the data by region or product category â€” enhancing interactivity without needing to adjust formulas or raw data. The visualizations included:

Sales by Region: Showed the West as the top-performing region

Sales by Category: Revealed Technology as the highest-grossing category

Sales by Segment: Highlighted how different customer types contributed to overall sales

This dashboard offers a clear, actionable overview of company performance, helping decision-makers understand which areas to focus on without the complexity of time-based KPIs.

# Q&A: Sales Performance Dashboard in Excel
ðŸ”¹ Q1: What was the objective of this task? A: To design an Excel-based dashboard that visualizes sales performance using business dimensions like region, category, and customer segment â€” with interactive features like slicers and pivot charts.

ðŸ”¹ Q2: How did you prepare the dataset? A: I removed duplicates, corrected formatting issues, and used formulas to convert text data into structured columns, such as extracting the year from Order ID.

ðŸ”¹ Q3: Why didnâ€™t you use monthly trends or KPI cards? A: The focus was on categorical sales breakdown for strategic decision-making, rather than time-series analysis. This made the dashboard simpler, cleaner, and more relevant to stakeholders.

ðŸ”¹ Q4: What Excel features were used? A: I used Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, and functions like MID, VALUE, and TEXT to structure the data and provide dynamic interactivity.

ðŸ”¹ Q5: What did the dashboard reveal? A: It showed that: West was the top-performing region Technology was the most profitable category The Consumer segment drove the highest sales volume

ðŸ”¹ Q6: How does interactivity help in the dashboard? A: Slicers allow users to filter by region or category and instantly see changes in the visualizations â€” enabling non-technical users to explore insights easily.
